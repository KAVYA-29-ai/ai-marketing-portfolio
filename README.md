âš¡ Challenges / Kamiyan

Form Submission Storage

Currently, generated proposals are not saved in a database.

Only live output is available; no history tracking for users.

AI Reliability & Edge Cases

AI sometimes may generate generic or slightly off-target content depending on input clarity.

Rarely, longer inputs may exceed token limits.

Limited Customization

Users cannot fully customize tone, style, or format of generated content yet.

Offline Limitations

Requires internet connection to communicate with the AI API.

ðŸš€ Future Improvements

Database Integration

Save user submissions for later access or analytics.

Advanced Customization

Allow users to select tone, style, and length for AI outputs.

Enhanced AI Models

Add fallback models (Hugging Face or local AI) in case the main LLM API fails.

Authentication & User Profiles

Users can log in, view history, and download generated case studies/proposals.

Analytics & Feedback

Track which case studies or proposals are most generated to improve AI prompts.
